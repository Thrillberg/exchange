# Exchange [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/exchange.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/exchange)

Exchange aspires to be responsible for the various types of e-commerce interactions available on the Artsy platform. It's currently a prototype, with legacy e-commerce still handled by Gravity. It uses Ruby, Rails, Postgresql, and exposes a [GraphQL](http://graphql-ruby.org/) API.

## Did You Change GraphQL Schema?
Metaphysics is the current consumer of Exchange GraphQL schema and keeps a copy of latest schema in https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/tree/master/src/data, if you have changed Exchange GraphQL schema, make sure you also update the copy of this schema in Metaphysics. In order to do so follow these steps:
1) In exchange run
```shell
rake graphql:schema:idl
```
2) rename `schema.graphql` file generated ‚òùüèº to `exchange.graphql`
```shell
mv schema.graphql exchange.graphql
```
3) copy file above to your local update Metaphysics under `src/data` and make a PR to Metaphysics with this change
